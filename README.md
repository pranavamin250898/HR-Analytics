HR Attrition Analysis Dashboard
This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of employee attrition, offering insights into various factors that impact employee turnover in an organization. The dashboard was developed using PowerBI.

Overview of the Dashboard
The HR Attrition Analysis Dashboard consists of several key sections:

Total Employees & Attrition Count: Displays the total number of employees (1,470) and the number of employees who have left the organization (237), with an overall attrition rate of 16.12%.

Employee Status & Demographics:

Active Employees: Shows the number of current active employees (1,233).
Average Age: The average age of employees is calculated to be 36.92 years.
Education Field-Wise Attrition: A bar chart visualizes attrition based on educational background, highlighting fields with the highest attrition rates. Life Sciences and Medical fields show higher attrition compared to other fields like Human Resources and Marketing.

Department-Wise Attrition: A pie chart breaks down attrition by department, with Research & Development showing the highest percentage (56.1%) of attrition, followed by Sales (38.8%) and Human Resources (5.1%).

Job Satisfaction Rating: A table categorizes employees by job role and satisfaction rating on a scale of 1-4. This breakdown helps in identifying roles with lower job satisfaction, which could be related to higher attrition rates.

Age Group & Gender Analysis:

A bar chart depicts the distribution of employees across age groups (Under 25, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, Over 55) and gender. The 25-34 age group has the highest number of employees, with a nearly balanced gender ratio.
Donut charts display attrition by gender within each age group, providing an in-depth view of gender-specific attrition trends for different age categories.
Key Insights and Conclusions
Based on the data presented in the HR Attrition Analysis Dashboard, the following conclusions can be drawn:

Higher Attrition in Certain Education Fields: Employees with backgrounds in Life Sciences and Medical fields show the highest attrition rates. This may indicate either a higher demand for talent in these fields outside the organization or potentially job satisfaction issues within these areas that need to be addressed.

Departmental Variations in Attrition:

Research & Development: With a significant portion of attrition (56.1%), this department may need to investigate potential factors like workload, advancement opportunities, or compensation competitiveness.
Sales: With 38.8% of attrition, the Sales department also shows a notable rate of turnover, potentially due to high-pressure environments or unmet career expectations.
Human Resources: This department has the lowest attrition rate (5.1%), which could suggest higher job stability or satisfaction among HR employees.
Job Role and Satisfaction:

Roles like Sales Executive and Laboratory Technician have the highest counts in terms of job roles, suggesting that these roles might have a higher turnover due to lower job satisfaction ratings or other job-specific factors.
Manufacturing Director and Research Director positions have slightly better satisfaction ratings but still contribute to attrition, pointing to potential room for improvement in leadership roles.
Age and Gender Impact on Attrition:

The 25-34 age group has the largest number of employees and shows the highest attrition rate, particularly among males. This age group often experiences career shifts and may be more susceptible to turnover for better opportunities.
The Under 25 and Over 55 groups have relatively lower attrition. Young employees may still be gaining experience, while older employees might have more stability and commitment.
Gender-Specific Trends: Attrition appears to be relatively balanced across genders in most age categories, but some age groups, such as 35-44, show slightly higher attrition rates among males.
Conclusion
The HR Attrition Analysis Dashboard provides actionable insights into employee attrition trends within the organization. Some key takeaways include:

There is a need to focus on retention strategies for employees in the Life Sciences and Medical fields and for roles with lower job satisfaction.
The high attrition in Research & Development and Sales departments suggests that addressing job-specific challenges in these areas could improve retention rates.
Targeted interventions for the 25-34 age group may reduce attrition in this demographic, which forms a significant portion of the workforce.
Improving job satisfaction in high-turnover roles like Sales Executive and Laboratory Technician could positively impact attrition rates.
This dashboard enables HR professionals to make data-driven decisions and design targeted retention programs, ultimately supporting the goal of reducing attrition and improving organizational stability.
